# small_projects

This is a place for small projects that I work on while learning the basics to Python. Hopefully I can make a few games, but the purpose of these exercises is to become familiar with Python syntax and Python capabilities. 

Ideally, I will be able to graduate to more complicated materials within the next few months. (10/18/2024)
